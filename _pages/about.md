👋 Hi!  
======

My name is Daniel Anadria and I am pursuing a doctoral degree in natural language processing (NLP) at Utrecht University under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Daniel Oberski and Dr. Anastasia Giachanou as part of the [Algorithmic Society](https://algosoc.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} consortium.

My interests involve:

- NLP & Text Mining 📚⛏️
- Clinical Data Science
- Algorithmic Fairness 🤖⚖️
- Explainable AI 🔎🦾

<!--I have a background in text mining, applied data science, methodology and statistics, and research psychology.  -->

<!-- I mostly use:

🔬 Research 
======

My research explores ways to ensure that AI systems in healthcare uphold public values such as fairness and transparency. In particular, I focus on detection and mitigation of bias in clinical NLP systems.
