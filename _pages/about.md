Hi! 👋 
======

My name is Daniel Anadria and I am pursuing a doctoral degree in clinical natural language processing (NLP) at Utrecht University.


I have a background in text mining, applied data science, methodology and statistics, and research psychology. 


My research explores ways to ensure that automated decision-making systems in healthcare uphold public values such as fairness and transparency. In particular, I focus on bias detection and mitigation in the context of NLP algorithms deployed in healthcare. My supervisors at Utrecht University are Dr. Anastasia Giachanou and Prof. Dr. Daniel Oberski.

If you're interesting in any of my work or if you think I might be able to help you with yours, feel free to [reach out!](mailto:danadria@uu.nl)


<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->
