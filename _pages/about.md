👋 Hi!  
======

My name is Daniel Anadria and I am pursuing a doctoral degree in clinical natural language processing (NLP) at Utrecht University.


I have a background in text mining, applied data science, methodology and statistics, and research psychology. I mostly use:

🔬 Research 
======

My research explores ways to ensure that automated decision-making systems in healthcare uphold public values such as fairness and transparency. In particular, I focus on bias detection and mitigation in the context of NLP algorithms deployed in healthcare. My supervisors at Utrecht University are Dr. Anastasia Giachanou and Prof. Dr. Daniel Oberski.

<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->
