👋 Hi!  
======

My name is Daniel Anadria and I am a doctoral researcher in trustworthy artificial intelligence at Utrecht University and University Medical Center Utrecht. My work focuses on methodologies for the development, implementation, and assessment of statistical decision support systems. I'm interested in ways to assess and ensure that AI systems exhibit desirable properties such as fairness, transparency, safety, and conformance to the EU and national regulations. My ongoing projects focus on clinical decision support systems within the healthcare domain.

🎓 Academic Background  
======

I am a data scientist and statistician. I also hold a psychology degree and have a background in natural language processing and explainable AI. I'm curious and love learning new things. In my choice of methods, I am solution-oriented and syncretist. I look over the disciplinary hedge to find solutions that work and enable succesful deployment of AI.


📍 Affiliations
