👋 Hi!  
======

My name is Daniel Anadria and I am pursuing a doctoral degree in clinical data science at Utrecht University under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Daniel Oberski and Dr. Anastasia Giachanou.

My interests involve:

- Algorithmic Justice 🤖⚖️
- Explainable AI 🔎🦾
- Natural Language Processing & Text Mining 📚⛏️


<!--I have a background in text mining, applied data science, methodology and statistics, and research psychology.  -->

<!-- I mostly use: 

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-05122A?style=flat&logo=python)&nbsp;
![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jupyter-05122A?style=flat&logo=Jupyter)&nbsp;
![R (Statistics)](https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-05122A?style=flat&logo=R&logoColor=276DC3)&nbsp;

🔬 Research 
======

My research explores ways to ensure that AI systems in healthcare uphold public values such as fairness and transparency. In particular, I focus on bias detection and mitigation in the context of natural language processing systems deployed in healthcare.


I am a member of:

- [The Algorithmic Society](https://algosoc.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Natural Language and Text Processing (NLTP) Lab](https://nlp.sites.uu.nl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
<!-- - [Mice Team](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/missing-data){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} -->
- [Human Data Science](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/researchers/)


<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->

🗞️ What's new? 
======
- A collaboration [article](https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2023.2250920) with Caspar van Lissa and Mauricio Garnier-Villarreal is published in Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal 🥳

- The [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/67zmt/) of my recent collaboration with Jelle Teijema is out! 🙌
- Will be a TA in [Data Science: Introduction to Text Mining with R](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-introduction-to-text-mining-with-r) and [Data Science: Applied Text Mining](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-applied-text-mining)
- Joined the European Workshop for Algorithmic Fairness ([EWAF'23](https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf23/)) as a proceedings chair! 🪑
- Defended MSc Thesis! 🎉
