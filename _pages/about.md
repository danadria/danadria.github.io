Hi! 👋 
======

My name is Daniel Anadria. I am a rising statistician and data scientist pursuing a PhD at Utrecht University's Department of Methodology and Statistics and the Algorithmic Society Consortium (AlgoSoc). I have a background in psychology, methodology and statistics for behavioral, biomedical and social sciences, and applied data science with a strong focus on natural language processing (NLP). 

I am researching ways to implement fair and transparent automated decision-making systems in healthcare, specifically focusing on NLP-systems for clinical decision-making. My supervisors at Utrecht University are Dr. Anastasia Giachanou and Prof. Dr. Daniel Oberski.


<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->


My interests involve:

- Text-Mining & NLP
- Algorithmic Fairness & Explainable AI
- Feature Attribution & Feature Selection
- Deep Learning
- Latent Class Analysis & Structural Equation Modeling
